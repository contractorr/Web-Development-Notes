Describe what the internet is.
* An infrastructure of connected computers - through wires (copper/fiber obtic) or signals
  (WiFi/Bluetooth)
* Some of these computers can send messages intelligible to web browsers. These are called web
  servers.
* The Web is a service built on the internet infrastructure
* IRC and email are other services built on the internet
What is a client?
* A typical computer
* Computer that is indirectly connected to the internet via an ISP
What is a Web Server?
* Computer that is directly connected to the internet
* Files on the harddrive are web pages
* Also has a unique IP address, as with all computers on the internet
* In the case of web servers, this IP address also has an alias called a domain name (e.g.
  google.com)
Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.
* Packets - each packet contains instructions on how it fits together,where it came from and where
  it's going.
* Modems turn information from networks into a form manageable by the telephone infrastructure and
  vice versa.
* An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can
  also access other ISPs' routers.
  The message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination
  network.
* Each computer on the internet has unique IP address which can be looked up using domain name
  server (DNS - giant address book). When you type a web address in your browser, it looks at
  the DNS to find the website's read address.
* Each time two or more parts of the internet intersect, there will be a router. These Routers
  guide packets to correct destination. 10-15 routers between client and server.
* Each router has own IP address. The ip addresses of each router is added to your packet on
  it's way to a server.
* Servers send back packets with an identical wrapping. As it makes its way back, each router
  unpacks a layer in order to find out where to send the packet next.
What is a web page?
* A HTML document that can be displayed in a web browser.
* Accessible through a unique address within the domain name
* A collection of web pages connected together form a website.
What is a web browser?
* A program on your computer that allows you to visit websites
What is a search engine?
* A web service that helps you find other web pages.
What happens when you search for a web address?
* The internet is like a road. Say you're sending Joe Smith to a shop. The DNS is like an address book.
  When you enter a web address, the browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the
  server. This is like looking up the physical address of your shop. There'll be a local DNS cache on
  your computer. The browser will check if it already knows the IP address. If it does it will skip the
  DNS server request.
* HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and
  servers to speak to each other. The browser will send an HTTP request message to the server asking for
  a copy of the website to the client. This is the equivalent of placing your order in English to Joe.
* TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define
  how data should travel across the web. Like types of vehicles - how Joe gets around on the roads.
* Component files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of
  the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
** Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
** Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images,
   music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.
* If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message and then
  starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.
* The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you. The data is
  sent as thousands of small chunks, so that many different web users can download the same website at
  the same time.
How are domain names structured?
* TLD (Top-Level Domain)
** TLDs tell users the general purpose of the service behind the domain name. The most generic TLDs
   (.com, .org, .net) don't require web services to meet any particular criteria, but some TLDs enforce
   stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example:
   - Local TLDs such as .us, .fr, or .se can require the service to be provided in a given language or
     hosted in a certain country.
   - TLDs containing .gov are only allowed to be used by government departments.
   - TLDs like .edu and .ac.uk are only for use by educational and academic institutions.
** TLDs can contain special as well as latin characters, and their maximum length is 63 characters
* Label (or component)
** The labels are what follow the TLD
** A label is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from 1 to 63 characters in length,
   containing only the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the - character (which may not be
   the first or last character in the label).
** The label located right before the TLD is called a Secondary Level Domain (SLD).
* In developer.mozilla.org, developer and mozilla are labels, while org is the TLD
* For any domain you control (e.g. mozilla.org), you can create "subdomains" with different content
  located at each, like developer.mozilla.org, iot.mozilla.org, or wiki.developer.mozilla.org.
* You pay for the right to use a domain name for one or more years. You can renew your right, and your
  renewal has priority over other people's applications. But you never own the domain name.
* Companies called registrars use domain name registries to keep track of technical and administrative
  information connecting you to your domain name. For some domain name, it might not be a registrar
  which is in charge of keeping track. For instance, every domain name under .fire is managed by Amazon.
* To find out whether a given domain name is available:
** Go to a domain name registrar's website. Most of them provide a “whois” service that tells you
   whether a domain name is available.
** Alternatively, if you use a system with a built-in shell, type a whois command into it, followed by
   the domain name.
* Go to a Regristrar's website to register a domain names
* DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these servers refer to a few special
  servers called “authoritative name servers” or “top-level DNS servers.”  Whenever your registrar
  creates or updates any information for a given domain, the information must be refreshed in every DNS
  database. Each DNS server that knows about a given domain stores the information for some time before
  it is refreshed. At this point the DNS server queries an authoritative server and fetches the updated
  information from it). It takes a few hours for the information to refresh on all DNS servers.
