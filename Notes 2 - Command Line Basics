* pwd will treat symlinked paths as if they were actual paths.
  E.g. /users/rcontrac/abc/def instead of /users/rcontrac/Dropbox/abc/def
* If we want to see the physical path with the symlinks resolved, use pwd -P
* Hidden files are prefixed on linux with a '.'. To see these use ls -a
* ls - l will list files alphabetically and give information on each one:
** File mode
** number of links
** owner name
** group name
** bytes
** date last modified
** pathname -> symlinks
** -h will give us size of files in Kb and Mb
** -S will sort the results of ls by file size (biggest first)
** -t will sort by last modified (recent first)
** -r will reverse the results
* mkdir
** -p a/b/c allows you to create nested directories a/b/c
** -v verbose
* cp source destination
** a.txt b.txt will copy a.txt and create a new file b.txt
** cp a.txt a/b/c will copy a/txt to a/b/c
** cp a.txt b.txt c.txt a/b/c will copy the three files to a/b/c
** cp *.txt will achieve the same result as above
** supports verbose output -v
** to copy directories use -r command
** use -f force command to overcome restrictions
** use -i command when copying many files to be warned if you're overwriting an
   existing file
* rm will delete files and directories
* mv will move files and directories. It is a combination of cp and rm.
* We can use the pipeline operator | to redirect the output of one command into
  another
** ls -l ~ | grep _ will find all the files in your home directory with an
   underscore.
* ls -l ~ | grep _ > store.txt will write the outputs to store.txt
* Open files in editor of your choice using for example atom file\ 1.txt or atom "file 1.txt"
* Select all contents of a directory at once using the . command. E.g. atom ~/Documents/Python/Week\ 1/.
