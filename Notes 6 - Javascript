JavaScript
* Invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla
* Developers have written tools to unlock extra functionality, including:
  * Browser Application Programming interfaces (APIs) - APIs built into web
    browsers providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting
    CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam,
    etc.
  * Third-party APIs - allow developers to incorporate functionality in their
    sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
  * Third-party frameworks and libraries.
* To incorporate JavaScript into your page, add a main.js file in your scripts
  folder and add the following line to your index.html body:
  <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
  This should be added after any HTML the JavaScript is supposed to affect. This
  is because the HTML is loaded by the browser in the order it appears in the
  file. It is usually the best strategy to put this just before the </body> tag.
* The let or var keywords can be used to declare a variable:
  let myVariable;
  myVariable = 'Bob'; // this is a comment
  let myNewVariable =  10; /* this is also a comment */
  let anotherVariable = [1, 'Steve', true, 11];
  let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
  In JavaScript, variables are case sensitive.
* === is the equality operator
* !== is not equal
* function multiply (num1,num2) {
    let result = num1*num2
    return result
  }
* if (a == b) {
  alert('a equals b')
  }else{
  //do something else
  }
* document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Click');
  }
  Here we've selected the <html> element and set its onclick handler property
  equal to an anynymous function which outputs Click.
* Let's make it so that if you click on a pic, it changes:
  let myImage = document.querySelector('img');
  myImage.onclick = function() {
      let mySrc = myImage.getAttribute('src');
      if(mySrc === 'images/pic-1.png') {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-2.png');
      } else {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-1.png');
      }
  }
* Let's say we want to add a button, which when clicked, resets the heading
  * we'd add the following to the index.html file:
    <button>Change user</button>
  * in the main.js script, we'd add the following:
    let myButton = document.querySelector('button');
    let myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
  * Now we add a function that asks the user for their name and stores it in a
    variable with the help of the setItem function within an API called
    localStorage:
    function setUserName() {
      let myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');
      if(!myName || myName === null) {
        setUserName();
      } else {
        localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
        myHeading.innerHTML = 'Welcome, ' + myName;
      }
    }
    if(!localStorage.getItem('name')) {
      setUserName();
    } else {
      let storedName = localStorage.getItem('name');
      myHeading.textContent = 'Welcome, ' + storedName;
    }
    myButton.onclick = function() {
      setUserName();
    }
