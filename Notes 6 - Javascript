JavaScript
Introduction
* Invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla
* Developers have written tools to unlock extra functionality, including:
  * Browser Application Programming interfaces (APIs) - APIs built into web
    browsers providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting
    CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam,
    etc.
  * Third-party APIs - allow developers to incorporate functionality in their
    sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
  * Third-party frameworks and libraries.
* To incorporate JavaScript into your page, add a main.js file in your scripts
  folder and add the following line to your index.html body:
  <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
  This should be added after any HTML the JavaScript is supposed to affect. This
  is because the HTML is loaded by the browser in the order it appears in the
  file. It is usually the best strategy to put this just before the </body> tag.
Variables
* The let or var keywords can be used to declare a variable:
  let myVariable; /* myVariable will be undefined. Doing a mathematical
                     operation on this will result in a NaN. */
  myVariable = 'Bob'; // You can also use ""
  let myNewVariable =  10;
  let anotherVariable = [1, 'Steve', true, 11];
  let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
  In JavaScript, variables are case sensitive.
* Unlike the var keyword, if you declare a variable using let, you will get an
  error if that variable is overwritten.
* Declaring a variable with var creates a global variable (or local if declared
  in a function). This can cause problems:
    var printNumTwo;
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      if (i === 2) {
        printNumTwo = function() {
          return i;
        };
      }
    }
    console.log(printNumTwo());
    // returns 3
  So to get around this, we use the let keyword:
    'use strict';
    let printNumTwo;
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      if (i === 2) {
        printNumTwo = function() {
          return i;
        };
      }
    }
    console.log(printNumTwo());
    // returns 2
    console.log(i);
    // returns "i is not defined"
  Here i is not defined globally so we can't reference it outside the loop.
  Inside the loop, three different i variables are crated, with unique values 0,
  1 and 2.
    function checkScope() {
      'use strict';
      let i = 'function scope';
      if (true) {
        let i = 'block scope';
        console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
      }
      console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
      return i;
    }
    // Block scope i is:  block scope
    // Function scope i is:  function scope
* Mutability: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers
  for 'immutable' values (e.g. FAV_PET) and lowercase or camelCase for mutable
  values.
  * The keyword const is used to declare variables whose identifier can't be
    reassigned. Although const variables are regarded as 'immutable', they're not:
      "use strict";
      const s = [5, 6, 7];
      s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
      s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
      console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
  * If you actually want your data to be immutable, use Object.freeze.
      let obj = {
        name:"FreeCodeCamp",
        review:"Awesome"
      };
      Object.freeze(obj);
      obj.review = "bad"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
      obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
      console.log(obj);
      // { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}
* When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of
  undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your
  result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string
  with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
Arithmetic
* if a = 1, then a += 5; will turn a into 6.
* === is the equality operator
* !== is not equal
* function multiply (num1,num2) {
    let result = num1*num2
    return result
  }
* if (a == b) {
  alert('a equals b')
  }else{
  //do something else
  }
* JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number
  between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive).
* Math.floor() rounds down to the nearest whole number.
  * Math.floor(Math.random() * 20); // will generate a number between 1 - 19
* The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a
  second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the
  string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.
  * var a = parseInt("11", 2); //33
 String Operations
* 'My name is Raj' + ' Contractor.'; //This is concatenation
* var myStr = 'My name is Raj';
  myStr += ' Contractor.';
* var myName = 'Raj ';
  var secondName = 'Contractor';
  myName += secondName;
* secondName.length // Will return 10
* secondName[0] //will return C
* secondName[secondName.length - 1] // will return the last character
* Unlike arrays, strings are immutable, meaning you can't change the individual
  characters of a string literal. secondName[0] = D; will not do anything. You
  would have to reassign a new string to secondName.
Array Operations
* .pop() /* will remove and return the last element. You can assign this to a
            variable */
* .push(10) // adds an 10 to the end of your array
* .shift() /* will remove and return the first element. You can assign this to a
            variable */
* .unshift(10) // adds 10 to the front of your array
Escape characters
\' single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n newline
\r carriage return
\t tab
\b word boundary
\f form feed
Functions
* function myFunction(param1,param2) {
  console.log(param1,param2);
  }
* if you don't use var, your variable will be global even if declared in the
  function.
* two variables can share the same name if one is global and the other local
* document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Click');
  }
* Functions don't have to have a return statement. Without one, the returned
  value will be 'undefined'
* We don't have to name functions if they won't be reused:
    const myFunc = function() {
      const myVar = "value";
      return myVar;
    }
  or
    const myFunc = () => {
      const myVar = "value";
      return myVar;
    }
  * If there is no body and only a return value, we can just write:
      const myFunc = () => "value";
  * If there is only one argument or line of code, you can omit the parentheses /
    curly brackets:
      const doubler = item => item * 2;
  * You can have a default parameter:
      const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello, " + name;
* You can have a variable number of arguments into a function using the rest
  parameter
    function howMany(...args) {
      return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
    }
* you can unpack an array using the spread operator:
    var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
    var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr); // returns 89
  The Math.max() function expects comma-separated arguments, which is why we
  have to use apply. Instead, we could have just used the spread operator:
    var maximus = Math.max(..arr);
  You can copy all contents of one array to another using the spread operator:
    arr2 = [...arr1];
Here we've selected the <html> element and set its onclick handler property
equal to an anynymous function which outputs Click.
* Let's make it so that if you click on a pic, it changes:
  let myImage = document.querySelector('img');
  myImage.onclick = function() {
      let mySrc = myImage.getAttribute('src');
      if(mySrc === 'images/pic-1.png') {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-2.png');
      } else {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-1.png');
      }
  }
* && = AND operator
* || = OR operator
* switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
} // the default statement is executed if num doesn't match any case statements
* function isEquals(a,b) {
  return a === b;
} // avoid if-else statements where possible
The Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
* condition ? statement-if-true : statement-if-false;
* E.g.
    function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
      return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal"
        : (a > b) ? "a is greater"
        : "b is greater";
    }
* You should only use once, instead of chaining them together as above
Objects
* JavaScript Objects store properties in a key-value format.
* Defining objects:
    var anotherObject = {
      make: "Ford",
      5: "five",
      "model": "focus"
    }; /* you can omit quotes for single-word properties. Any non-string
       properties are automatically typecast as strings.*/
* You can access object properties via the dot or bracket notation. You have to
  use brackets if the property name is multiple words.
* You would add/update properties in the same way. If the property already
  exists, it'll be updated. Else it'll be added:
  * anotherObject.make = "Nissan";
  * anotherObject["name"] = "Nissan";
  * var temp = "name";
    anotherObject[temp] = "Nissan";
* Properties can be removed using: delete anotherObject.name;
* Objects can be used to replace if-else and switch statements:
    var alpha = {
      1:"Z",
      2:"Y",
      3:"X",
      4:"W",
    };
    alpha[2]; // "Y"
* use .hasOwnProperty(propname) to check if an object has that property
* A JavaScript object is an example of a flexible data structure because it
  allows for an arbitrary combination of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays,
  functions and objects.
    var ourMusic = [
      {
        "artist": "Daft Punk",
        "title": "Homework",
        "release_year": 1997,
        "formats": [
          "CD",
          "Cassette",
          "LP"
        ],
        "gold": true
      }
    ];
  This is an array with one object inside. The object has a nested "formats"
  array.
* Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a related data interchange format used to
  store data.
* You can chaing together dot or bracket notation to access nested Objects, e.g.
  ourStorage.desk.drawer;
  * You can define object literals in two ways:
    * The ES5 way:
      const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
        "use strict";
        return {
          name: name,
          age: age,
          gender: gender
        };
      };
    * The ES6 way:
      const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
        "use strict";
        return ({name,age,gender});
      };
      // in both of the above cases, createPerson("Zodiac Hasbro", 56, "male")
      // will return {name: "Zodiac Hasbro", age: 56, gender: "male"}.
  * You can define functions inside objects in two ways:
    * The ES5 way:
      const person = {
        name: "Taylor",
        sayHello: function() {
          return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
        }
      };
    * The ES6 way:
      const person = {
        name: "Taylor",
        sayHello() {
          return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
        }
      }
* JavaScript doesn't have a fully-fledged class implementation of an object-
  oriented paradigm. If we want to define our own class and initiate an object
  of that class, there are two ways:
  * The ES5 way:
    var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
      this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
    }
    var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
  * The ES6 way:
    class SpaceShuttle {
      constructor(targetPlanet){
        this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
      }
      // getter
      get writer() {
        return this._author;
      }
      // setter
      set writer(updatedAuthor) {
        this._author = updatedAuthor;
      }
    }
    const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
    // The class keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is
    // added. This constructor is envoked when new is called to create a new
    // object. UpperCamelCase should be used for class names. You can also
    // define getter and setter functions as above. The syntax is not the same
    // as a typical function. They hide the internal implementation details.
    // Private variables should begin with an underscore.
    const lol = new Book('anonymous');
    console.log(lol.writer);  // anonymous
    lol.writer = 'wut';
    console.log(lol.writer);  // wut
Destructuring Assignment:
  * You can assign out values from an object using destructuring assignment:
      const user = { name: 'John', age: 34};
    If you wanted to assign new variables for this object's properties, instead
    of:
      const name = user.name; //name = 'John'
      const age = user.age; //age = 34
    You could use:
      const { name, age} = user; //name = 'John', age = 34
    Or:
      const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user; // userName = 'John'...
  * You can still use them if your object is nested:
      const user = {
        johnDoe: {
          age: 34,
          email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
        }
      };
      const { johnDoe: {age: userAge, email: userEmail}} = user;
  * You can also destructure arrayrs:
      // assign values from an array. a, b and c don't need to be declared.
      const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
      console.log(a, b, c); // 1, 2, 5
      // swap values assigned to existing variables
      let a = 8, b = 6;
      [a,b] = [b,a];
      // while destructuring an array, store the rest of the array into a
      // separate veriable
      const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
      console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
      console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]
  * You can destructure an object passed into a function:
      const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
        const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
        // do something with these variables
      }
      // The above can be converted to:
      const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
        /* do something with these fields */
      }
      // This way only the relevant fields are copied inside the function
Template Literals
* These are special types of strings that are enclosed by backticks instead of '
  or ". You don't need to insert \n for a newline, or concatenate using +:
  const person = {
    name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
    age: 56
  };

  // Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation
  const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
  I am ${person.age} years old.`;

  console.log(greeting); // prints
  // Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!
  // I am 56 years old.
Loops
* While notation:
    var ourArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    while(i < 5) {
    ourArray.push(i);
    i++;
    }
* For notation:
    var ourArray = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    ourArray.push(i);
    }
  * You can replace ++ with += or -= to iterate by whatever you want
* Do-while notation:
    var ourArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    do {
      ourArray.push(i);
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);
    * use this if you want the code to be executed at least once
Resursion
* You can replace for loops with recursion:
  * For loop:
      function multiply(arr, n) {
        var product = 1;
        for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            product *= arr[i];
        }
        return product;
      }
  * Equivalent recursive function:
      function multiply(arr, n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
          return 1;
        } else {
          return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
        }
      }
* Let's say we want to add a button, which when clicked, resets the heading
  * we'd add the following to the index.html file:
    <button>Change user</button>
  * in the main.js script, we'd add the following:
    let myButton = document.querySelector('button');
    let myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
  * Now we add a function that asks the user for their name and stores it in a
    variable with the help of the setItem function within an API called
    localStorage:
    function setUserName() {
      let myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');
      if(!myName || myName === null) {
        setUserName();
      } else {
        localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
        myHeading.innerHTML = 'Welcome, ' + myName;
      }
    }
    if(!localStorage.getItem('name')) {
      setUserName();
    } else {
      let storedName = localStorage.getItem('name');
      myHeading.textContent = 'Welcome, ' + storedName;
    }
    myButton.onclick = function() {
      setUserName();
    }
Modularisation
* You can export and import parts of a file in order to reuse that code in other
  JavaScript files.
* You need to create a script in the <body> tag of your HTML document. A script
  of 'module' type can use import and export features:
    <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
  * There are two ways to export code:
      export const add = (x, y) => {
        return x + y;
      }
    Indirectly:
     export { add, subtract };
  * To import the code:
      import { add, subtract } from './filename.js';
      import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
      // myMathModule is an object and you can access its functions:
      myMathMoudle.add(2,3);
  * If only one function is being exported, you can set it as default:
      export default function add(x, y) {
        return x + y;
      }
      import myAdd from "./math_functions.js";
      // note no curly brackets around myAdd, and myAdd doesn't have to match
      the name of the default export from math_functions.js.
Promises
* Used for asynchronous tasks. When the task completes, you either fulfill your
  promise or don't. Promise is a constructor function. It takes a function as
  an argument. The function, in turn, has two parameters - resolve and reject:
    const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
      if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
      } else {
        reject("Data not received");
      }
    });
    // A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled and rejected.
  * It is useful when a process thakes an unknown amount of time (e.g. server
    request).The then method is executed immediately after your promise is
    fulfilled with resolve:
      makeServerRequest.then(result => {
        console.log(result);
        }
      );
  * Similarly, the catch method is run immediately after a promise's reject
    method is called:
      makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
Regular Expressions
* The .test(str) method takes a regular expression and applies it to str,
  returning true or false depending on whether a match is found E.g.
    let str = "The dog chased the cat";
    let testRegEx = /chased/;
    testRegEx.test(str); // returns true
* You can use flags to adjust what you match:
  * the i flag will ignore case - e.g. /chased/i;
  * the gi will extract or search a pattern multiple times - e.g.
      let repeatRegex = /Repeat/g;
      let testStr = "Repeat, Repeat, Repeat";
      testStr.match(repeatRegex); // Returns ["Repeat","Repeat","Repeat"]
* While the .test() method is called on a regular expression, .match() is called
  on a string and we pass in the regular expression. The .match() method
  extracts the expression out of the string:
    "Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
    // Returns ["Hello"]
    let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
    let ourRegex = /expressions/;
    ourStr.match(ourRegex);
    // Returns ["expressions"]
  *
