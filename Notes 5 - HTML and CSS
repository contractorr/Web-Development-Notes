Files
* The files your website needs should be kept in a single folder that mirrors
  the published website's file structure on the server.
* Many computers and servers are case sensitive, so be careful when naming
  files. It is generally best to use lower case and use dashes instead of
  spaces. Servers might replace a space with %20, which is the character code
  for spaces. The google search engine treats a dash as a word separator, but
  does not regard an underscore that way.
* Usually you'll have at least the following folders:
  * index.html - containing you homepage content including text and images
  * images filder - containing all your images
  * styles folder - containing all your CSS code
  * scripts folder - containing all the JavaScript code
* You need to provide a path between files in your index.html

* Windows uses backslashes but this desn't make any difference - continue using
  forwardslashes in html. The path navigation commands are the same as in unix.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
* Stuff under the heading should go in the <main></main> element
* A HTML element consists of an opening tag, the content and a closing tag. The
  type of element is specified in the opening/closing tags.
* Elements can have attributes. Attributes consist of a name followed by a value
  in quotation marks:
  <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
  You can omit the quotation marks for simple attributes without whitespace or
  ASCII characters.
* If you don't have any content then you don't need a closing tag
  <img src="http://www.htmldog.com/badge1.gif" alt="My test image">
  Here the alt attribute contains descriptive text for users who cannot see the
  image, which can happen if the user is visually imparied or something has gone
  wrong with your web page.
  * JPEGs should be used for photographs. They will distort the image due to
    compression.
  * GIFs are limited to 256 colours. They allow pixels to be transparent. Fewer
    colours = smaller file size. The colour of the original image is preserved.
    Should be used for for images with solid colours, such as icons or logos.
  * PNG replicaes colours like a GIF but allows 16m colours as well as alpha
    transparency (50% transparency for an area). These should be used for
    versatile images.
  * The smaller the file size of your pictures, the quicker your page will load.
* The <html></html> element is known as the root element
* The <head></head> element contains stuff you're not going to show to viewers.
  E.g. page description and keywords for search results, CSS, etc.
* The <meta charset="utf-8"> element sets the character set to UTF-8.
* The <title></title> element is what appears in your browser tab. It is also
  used in bookmarks/favourites. All HTML pages should have a title.
* HTML can contain 6 heading levels, <h1>-<h6>. Usually there is only one <h1>,
  which is the title of the page.
* The https:// or http:// part is called the protocol and must be included.
* The href/src link can be absolute, can link to another HTML file in the same
  directory/ image file in the image directory or send the user to another part
  of the same page. E.g. you can use the id attribute:
  <h2 id="test">Bring them here</h2>
  <a href="#test">Go to test heading</a>
  * Use href="#" as a placeholder if you don't want the link to go anywhere
  * target="_blank" after the href attribute will cause the link to open in a
    new tab
* We use forms to collect data input by a user. They're used in conjunction with
  a programming language, which will process the input.
* There are 4 basic tags used in the actual HTML of forms:
  * form defines the form:
    * <form action="processingscript.php" method ="post">...</form>
    * An action attribute will be needed to tell the form where it's contents
      will be sent.
    * A method attribute tells the form how the data will be sent. The default
      for this attribute is "get" (latches info to a web address) or "post"
      (sends the information)
  * the input tag has 5 main type attributes:
    * type="text". This is the default. A standard textbox. If a value attribute
      is also specified, you can set the initial text in the box. If a
      phaceholder attribut is specified, this will be in the input box.
    * type="passowrd". Same as text type except user's input will be hidden
    * type="checkbox". This can have a checked attribute
      <input type="checkbox" checked>
    * type="radio". Like a checkbox but only one button can be selected. Can
      also have a checked attribute.
      * Should be nested within a label element.
      * All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute. This will
        create a group and selecting one radio button will automatically
        deselect others.
      * It is best practice to include a for attribute that matches the ID on
        the child input element so that assistive technologies can create links
        between the parent and child.
      * Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their name and value attribute
        when submitted. In the below case the form data will be: indoor-outdoor=indoor
        <label for="indoor">
          <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
        </label>
    * type="submit". This is a button that will submit the form. It has a value
      attribute that will be displayed on the button
      <input type="submit" value"Submit">
    * this usually goes inside a form:
      <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
        <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
        <button type="submit">submit</button>
      </form
  * <textarea rows="5" cols="20">initial value of textarea</textarea>
  * <select>
        <option>A</option>
        <option selected>B</option>
        <option value="third option">C</option>
    </select>
    This is a dropdown. In this case B will be default selected. When the form
    is submitted the value of the selected option will be sent unless a value
    attribute is specified (A,B,third option).
* In HTML, span (in-line) and div (block-line) are meaningless tags used in
  conjunction with CSS to group chunks of code:
  <div id="scissors">
    <p>This is <span class="paper">crazy</span></p>
  </div>
* The form, input, textarea and select tags need to have a name attribute.
  <form action="contactus.php" method="post">
    <p>Name:</p>
    <p><input type="text" name="name" value="Your name"></p>
    <p>Species:</p>
    <p><input name="species"></p>
    <!-- remember: 'type="text"' isn't actually necessary -->
    <p>Comments: </p>
    <p><textarea name="comments" rows="5" cols="20">Your comments</textarea></p>
    <p>Are you:</p>
    <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="male"> Male</p>
    <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="female"> Female</p>
    <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="hermaphrodite"> An hermaphrodite</p>
    <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="asexual"> Asexual</p>
    <p><input type="submit"></p>
  </form>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* There are three main ways to apply CSS styling.
  * You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style
    attribute.
  * You can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
  * You can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file
    in the HTML document.
* This is a style sheet language. This means you can apply styles selectively to
  elements in HTML documents.
* You can apply CSS to HTML in three ways:
  * Inline - to be avoided: <p style="color: red">text</p>
  * Internal/Embedded styles are used for the whole page and found inside the
    head element. Also to be avoided:
    <style>
        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
  * External - this stuff goes in the style.css file in the styles folder. The
    head elements in the index.html file will need to be updated with the
    following:
    <link href="styles/style.css" ref="stylesheet">
    To turn all the paragraphs, lists and headings on a HTML page red, add the
    following to your style.css file:
    p, li, h1 {
      font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-sherif;
      font-size: 14p;
      color:red;
      width: 500px; /* px means pixels */
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
* IN CSS instead of elements you have rule sets. These consist of a selector and
  declaration.
  * The selector specifies the element(s) you'd like to style
  * The declaration contains a single rule, specifying which of the element's
    properties you want to style (property), as well as how you'd like to style
    it (property value). These go inside curly brackets.
* The selector can select more than just element types. Here are the most common
  selector types:
  * You can define your own selectors using class and ID selectors. This allows
    the same element to be presented differently depending on it's class or ID.
    * Class selector selects elements of the specified class. E.g.
      <style>.blue-text {color: blue;}</style>
      <p class="blue-text">. Class is used to identify multiple elements.
    * ID selector selects he element on the page with the specified ID. E.g.
      #my-id {} selects <p id="my-id"> and <a id="my-id">ID. ID is used to
      identify one element.
    * You can apply a selector to a specific element by stating the HTML
      selector. For example, to apply a style to paragraphs of class jam, use
      p.jam {}.
  * You can apply the same properties to multiple selectors.
    * You can group your classes E.g.
      h2, .Class_1, Class_2 { color: red; }
    * You can nest your classes
      #top    {background-color: #ccc;
               padding: 1em;}
      #top h1 {color: #ff0;}
      #top p  {color: red;}
               font-weight: bold;}
  * Attribute selector selects elements with the specified attribute. E.g.
    [img='src'] {} selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>
    [type=radio'] {margin: 1px 2px 1px 2px } will select radio buttons
  * Pseudo-class selector selects the specified elements only when in the
    specified state (e.g. being hovered over). E.g. a:hover selects <a> but only
    when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
    a:link{color: blue;}
    a:visited{color: purple;}
  * an element can inherit from multiple classes, e.g. <p class="red-text blue
    background">
  * When conflicts arise, inline styles override ids which override classes
    <p style="color:red" id="blue-text" class="green-text"
    Here the text will be red, then blue then green. If we prefer green to take
    precedence, we'd specify .green-text {color: green !important;}
* Lengths can be measured in px (pixels), em (unit for the calculated size of a
  font - e.g. 2em = 2*current font size), pt (unit for points, typically
  measured in printed media), % (unit for percentages).
* Colours can be specified by predefined names, three RGB values ranging from 0
  - 255 or by heladecimal which can be compressed (e.g.c96) which tells you RGB
  values, or uncompressed (#cc9966) which gives you more control.
* The font specified needs to be on the user's computer. It's safest to use
  Arial, Verdana and times new roman. You can specify multiple fonts, so the
  browser will go through until it finds a font it can use.
  * font-weight: bold /* can have bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400 (normal),
                         500, 600, 700 (same as bold), 800 or 900 */
  * font-style: italic
  * text-decoration: underline /* can also have overline or line-through.
                                  Underlines should only be used for links. */
  * text-transform: uppercase; /* can also have capitalize (changes first letter
                                  of every word to uppercase), lowercase. */
  * font-variant: small-caps
* You can also specify spacing
  * letter-spacing
  * word-spacing
  * line-height: 2; /* this will be 2*font size */
  * text-align: center; /*left, right, center or justify */
  * text-indent: 2; /* not really used /*
* You can add a link to your index.html file your page downloads a font family
  when it loads. This enables you to set it on your HTML elements. E.g.
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css">
  Then in your .css file
  html {
    font-size: 10px;
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
    background-color: #00539F;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 60px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0; /* gets rid of the default styling applied on the <h1> element */
    padding: 20px 0;
    color: #00539F;
    text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black; /* horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur
                                       radius, base colour */
  }
  p, li {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 2;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
  }
  body {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto; /* If only two values provided then the first value affects
                       the top and bottom, while the second affects the left and
                       right. Auto divides the available space equally */
    background-color: #FF9500;
    padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; /* If four values provided then the first value
                                  affects the top, then right, bottom and left,
                                  in that order */
    border: 5px solid black;
  }
  img {
    display: block; /* unlike the body element, which is block level, the img
                      element is inline, which means it cant have spacing values
                      such as margin. We include this command to apply margins
                      to the image. */
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
* You can adjust the size of margins and padding. Use margin, or margin-top/
  bottom/left/right and padding, or padding-top,bottom,left,bottom.
* CSS layout is based principally on the box model. Most of the HTML elements on
  a page can be thought of as boxes stacked on top of one another. Each box has
  * Margin
    * Border
      * Padding (the space immediately surrounding your content - the 'color',
        'text-shadow' and 'background-color' properties refer to this)
        * Element box
  This box model can be applied to every element on the page.
* Borders aren't set by default. If you want one, use border-style (solid,
  dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset and outset). You can also adjust
  the border-width using pixels. As with margins and padding, you can specify
  border-top/botton/right/left-width. Border-color sets the colour.

JavaScript
* Invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla
* Developers have written tools to unlock extra functionality, including:
  * Browser Application Programming interfaces (APIs) - APIs built into web
    browsers providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting
    CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam,
    etc.
  * Third-party APIs - allow developers to incorporate functionality in their
    sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
  * Third-party frameworks and libraries.
* To incorporate JavaScript into your page, add a main.js file in your scripts
  folder and add the following line to your index.html body:
  <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
  This should be added after any HTML the JavaScript is supposed to affect. This
  is because the HTML is loaded by the browser in the order it appears in the
  file. It is usually the best strategy to put this just before the </body> tag.
* The let or var keywords can be used to declare a variable:
  let myVariable;
  myVariable = 'Bob'; // this is a comment
  let myNewVariable =  10; /* this is also a comment */
  let anotherVariable = [1, 'Steve', true, 11];
  let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
  In JavaScript, variables are case sensitive.
* === is the equality operator
* !== is not equal
* function multiply (num1,num2) {
    let result = num1*num2
    return result
  }
* if (a == b) {
  alert('a equals b')
  }else{
  //do something else
  }
* document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Click');
  }
  Here we've selected the <html> element and set its onclick handler property
  equal to an anynymous function which outputs Click.
* Let's make it so that if you click on a pic, it changes:
  let myImage = document.querySelector('img');
  myImage.onclick = function() {
      let mySrc = myImage.getAttribute('src');
      if(mySrc === 'images/pic-1.png') {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-2.png');
      } else {
        myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/pic-1.png');
      }
  }
* Let's say we want to add a button, which when clicked, resets the heading
  * we'd add the following to the index.html file:
    <button>Change user</button>
  * in the main.js script, we'd add the following:
    let myButton = document.querySelector('button');
    let myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
  * Now we add a function that asks the user for their name and stores it in a
    variable with the help of the setItem function within an API called
    localStorage:
    function setUserName() {
      let myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');
      if(!myName || myName === null) {
        setUserName();
      } else {
        localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
        myHeading.innerHTML = 'Welcome, ' + myName;
      }
    }
    if(!localStorage.getItem('name')) {
      setUserName();
    } else {
      let storedName = localStorage.getItem('name');
      myHeading.textContent = 'Welcome, ' + storedName;
    }
    myButton.onclick = function() {
      setUserName();
    }
