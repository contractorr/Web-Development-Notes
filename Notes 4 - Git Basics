* Other VCSs use delta-based version control. This stores changes as a set of
  files and the changes made to each file over time.
  V1              V2              V3              V4              V5
  File A       Change_1                        Change_2
  File B                                       Change_1        Change_2
  File C       Change_1        Change_2                        Change_3
* Git uses a stream of snapshots. Every time you commit, git takes a snapshots
  and stores a reference to it. If files have not changed, Git only stores links
  to the previous identical files it has already stored.
  V1              V2              V3              V4              V5
  File A          A1              <-              A2              <-
  File B          <-              <-              B1              B2
  File C          C1              C2              <-              C3
* Most operation only need local files in order to work. Git is useful if you're
  offline.
* Everything in Git is checksummed before being stored. It's therefore
  impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing
  about it. You can't lose information in transit or get file corruption without
  Git detecting it. Git uses SHA-1 hash. Git stores this 40-character string
  value of each file's contents instead of file names.
* Git only adds data. This is good for data recovery.
* Git has 3 main stages - modified, staged and committed.
  - Modified: you have changed the file but not committed to the database. When
    you checkout a project, the files are pulled out of the compressed dabase in
    the Git directory and placed on disk. If a file has been modified but isn't
    in the Staging Area, it's said to be 'modified'.
  - Staged: marked a modified file to go into your next commit snapshots. This
    is a file in your Git directory that stored information about what will go
    into your next commit. This is technically called an index. A modified file
    in the Staging area is said to be 'staged'.
  - Committed: data is stored in your local database. This is where git stores
    the metadata and object database for your project. This is what is copied
    when you clone a repository from another.
* There are three main sections of a Git project: Working tree, staging area and
  Git directory
  Working Directory                Staging area                Git Directory

* We use Git add to start tracking files using Git
* The Git directory or repository is a hidden folder named .git in the root
  directory of your project. Such a repository can be created in two ways:
  - Cloning an existing repository from a remote server. Just open up where you
    want the repository stored and hit the git clone command followed by the
    repository URL
  - Initialising a new repository
* You can use 'status' command to check which files have been modified
* In Git, origin is the placeholder name for the URL of the remote repository.
  Git sets up the origin by default when it clones a rempte repository. You can
  use Origin to access the remote repository without having to enter a full URL.
  You can also have multiple remotes for a repository by giving each a unique
  name.
* In Git, master is the branch of the remote repository you want to push your
  changes to.
* In each project you'll have files you don't want to version control. Ignore
  rules for different projects is stored in github.com/github/gitignore. The
  list of files to ignore is kept in a ".gitignore" file in the root folder. You
  should define this before the first commit.
  - Simply add a .gitignore file and include any files you'd like ignored.
  - Adding a file name will ignore any files with this name, no matter where
    they're located.
  - If you only want to ignore one such file, it must not be in your root
    directory and you must add the path from the root directory to this file.
  - You can ignore all files with a particular extension - e.g. *.txt.
  - You can ignore all files in a certain folder using /path/to/folder/*

* You should commit often, and when making a commit:
  - only include changes that belong together
  - Begin your commit message with a short summary of the changes. If your
    change is substantial, leave out the -m parameter. Such changes should be
    followed by a body (separated by a blank line) which should tell you why you
    made the changes and more detail on what you changed.
  - Only commit work that is fully done and tested. Otherwise use 'Stash'
    feature.
* Git log
  - lists the commits in chronological order, beginning with the newest
    item. If there are more items than it can display on one page, the command
    line indicates this by showing a colon (":") at the end of the page. You can
    then go to the next page with the SPACE key and quit with the "q" key.
  - each commit is identified by its 'commit hash'. With centralised VCS you can
    use an ascending integer. In git, since everyone can work in parallel and
    offline, you can't number your commits. You can refer to your commit using
    just the first 7 characters, since this should be enough to make it unique.
  - use the -p flag to display more information, including a diff
* Use git remote -v to display the URL of your remote repository (origin)
